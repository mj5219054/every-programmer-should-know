echnology is magic

The cycle of technology: technology always goes through such a cycle, adopting new technologies to solve old problems, new technologies cause new problems, and new technologies must be resorted to to solve new problems.

An era of machines augmenting nature (improving speed of movement, saving stamina, darning clothes) has arrived at an era where machines are used to imitate or resemble nature (genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, medical device body implants). As we learn and apply these technologies, we gradually develop from applying nature to directly intervening in nature. So the story of this century will be a collision between what technology offers and what we feel comfortable with. So far, no one has come to the conclusion that,

The nature and mode of action of technology are simple, and there is no reason to think that technology is simpler in nature and mode of action than economics or law. But we must be mindful that technology is determining our future and the things we worry about. Social scientists know that technology is made up of internal components. In many cases, they also know how the internal components fit together to give rise to the technology. And some historians have "opened" many technological black boxes, exploring in detail the origins of these technologies and their evolution over time. But most of these "inside thoughts" only focus on a specific technology, such as semiconductors, radar, and the Internet, rather than technology in a general sense.

Things might be different if engineers could have been the main thinkers of the technology, because they are natural "inside thinkers". But when I asked the eminent technologist Walter Vincenti why so few engineers try to lay the theoretical foundations of their fields, his answer was: "Engineers only like problems that they can solve. ."

Certain technologies, such as lasers, jets, radars, rapid computer programs, and railroad locomotives, were not what they were when they first appeared, or at least when they were about to appear. The situation is not the same.

The jet is not a variant of the internal combustion engine or any other prior technology, nor is it a steady accumulation of technology from its "predecessor". So explaining this "novelty", that is, a mutant, fundamental novelty, has become the main obstacle for techno-evolutionists. [5] The emergence of fundamental new technologies, that is, the emergence of new species equivalent to living things, cannot yet be explained and explained. A very extreme way out is to study Darwinian theory harder, and then claim that if different designers can induce different technological "mutations", some of them and the ideas behind them may be fundamental. Therefore, it can be said that the evolution of technology can be fundamental and mutational, or it can be incremental. This sounds plausible, but if you look closely at how fundamental innovation is achieved in practice, it simply doesn't hold up. Radar arises from semiconductors. You can make whatever changes you like to the 1930s semiconductor coils, but you'll never get radar. Even if you can make any changes you like to the idea of ​​semiconductors, you still don't get the radar. Making radar requires a different principle of operation than making semiconductors.

Phenomena is an indispensable source from which technology is produced. [1] All techniques, no matter how simple or complex, are actually disguised after applying one or several phenomena.

Let me use the following example to convince you of this point. Suppose you are asked to measure something that is not easy to measure. Say you are in zero gravity outer space and you need to measure the mass of a small piece of metal. At this point you can't put it on a balance, or hang it like a pendulum, or hang it on the lower end of a spring and let it oscillate up and down, because all of that requires gravity. At this point you can hang it between two springs to make it vibrate, or find a way to make it gain acceleration, and then measure the required force, so you can indirectly measure its mass. But note that what you're looking for here is a phenomenon or effect, but that effect may not be the same thing as you're trying to measure mass. As with all techniques, you need some solid phenomenon to build your method.

    Science and technology are two different concepts. Science is built on technology, and technology is built from both science and one's own experience.

    Science and technology have evolved in a symbiotic fashion, with each participating in the creation of the other, receiving, absorbing, and using the other. The two are intermingled, inseparable, and dependent on each other

    There are two main modes of invention:

• Begin at one end of the chain, from a given purpose or need, and then discover a principle that can be achieved.

• Start at the other end of the chain, starting with a phenomenon or effect and then gradually embedding some principles of how to use it.

  But no matter how varied the process of invention, in the end, we can group them into two big patterns. It may start at one end of the chain, stemming from a given purpose or need, and then discover a principle that can be achieved. Alternatively, it can start at the other end of the chain, starting with a phenomenon or effect that is often newly discovered, and then gradually embedding some principles on how to use it.
  In either mode, the process is not complete until the principle is translated into a working element. The two modes overlap to a great extent, so it is not necessary to describe both processes in detail. I will mainly explore the process of that type of pattern that begins with visible needs, and then I will briefly add another pattern that begins with phenomena.

Recursion plays out again, as each obstacle becomes its own sub-problem and requires its own solution (sub-principle or sub-technique). It wasn't until a viable climb plan was completed from the starting point to the summit that it meant a holistic solution. Of course, we may have had a glimpse of the mountain somewhere, that is, if a sub-technology is known to us, then its solution may be adopted. In this way, the whole process is more like stitching together the known, rather than being a pioneer in finding a completely unfamiliar path. This process is also recursive, and the entire event is internally cascading, which forms a forward plan, or, for us, a technical anticipation process.

Two development mechanisms for technology:

Internal replacement and structural deepening. Internal replacement is the replacement of a blocking component with a better component (sub-technology). Structural deepening refers to finding better parts, materials, or adding new components.

    This is how each technology begins a journey of development and evolution. [1] In fact, the journey may have begun long ago. In the process of translating basic concepts into physical form, people are already experimenting with different parts and constantly seeking to improve, so there is no clear line between the creation and development of technology.

    No matter how technology development begins, once it hits the road, different versions of the technology will emerge. Some of these versions are from the originators of the technology, some from other developers who are invading this new field,

    Still others may come from labs or small companies looking to develop new technologies. This is so, partly because these actors may have their own perspectives that define the concept, and partly because, as new technologies begin to adapt to different purposes or markets, there will be corresponding evolutions that will Slowly showing different versions.

This technology also needs to actively add secondary systems or secondary modules to accomplish the following purposes: (1) Strengthen basic performance. (2) Monitor and respond to changes or abnormalities. (3) To adapt to a wider range of tasks. (4) Enhance security and reliability.

This view is not limited to the orchestration level of technology. Since its sub-systems or integrated modules are themselves technologies, they also need to be developed, and they need to be forced to enhance the performance of the technology as a whole. Therefore, through a recursive process, a process of active improvement also occurs.

Designers will seek ways to push the limits, adding secondary systems based on the principles of (1)–(4) above to enhance performance, respond to changes in the environment, accommodate a wider range of tasks, and enhance reliability.

Newly added integrated blocks or subsystems are in turn pushed towards their own operational limits.

In the process of replacing old and new principles, old principles are often locked. There are 4 reasons why old principles usually exist for a long time:

• After a delicate and complicated process, an old principle that has matured will perform better than its newer counterpart.

• Adopting new principles may mean changing surrounding structures and organizations, which may not be implemented because of the prohibitive costs.

• Practitioners do not endorse the vision or promise of this new principle.

The same is true of its relation to the new principle. The greater the distance between the new and accepted solutions, the stronger the lock on the traditional ones. Hence, hysteresis exists, a delayed response to change. New technologies are held back by very successful old technologies, and the technological transition is neither easy nor smooth.

There are two modes of technical thought: one is formed around the core technology, and the other is constructed from a phenomenon cluster.

Whether domains are "crystallized" from a new technology or constructed from a cluster of phenomena, they arise from a pre-existing domain. This is because part of their origin and initial understanding must have come from somewhere, their so-called parent domain. For example, auxiliary computing did not arise from a processor or data bus, but from the components of the vacuum tube and its field of practice in the 1940s.

was born. Solve specific problems in the parent domain, solidify and develop in understanding and practice.

• Adolescence. Addressing developmental barriers, generating viable technologies and applying them to the market.

• Maturity. The market went from frenzy to calm, and the new domain deeply affected the economy in its own way and entered a stage of stable growth.

• Old age. Few important ideas are produced, some domains will be replaced, but most will survive and serve humanity.

The re-localization of the economy means that existing industries adapt to new technological bodies, extract and select what they need from them, and combine some of its components with some of the components in the new field, and sometimes create secondary production.

Generally speaking, the re-territorialization of the economy is to adapt an existing industry to a new technological body. But when they do so, they can't just adopt the new technology body, they also need to extract from the new technology body, select what they need, and combine some of its components with some of the components in the new field, and sometimes create secondary production. And when this happens, the domain in turn responds by adding new functionality to better suit the industries that will use it.

The whole process is uneven in the economy. Disequilibrium occurs when different industries, businesses and organizations encounter new technologies and are reconfigured in different ways and at different rates. It spreads outward as a result of changes in small-scale economic activity, changing business organizations and institutions, and ultimately changing society itself. A new version of the economy is slowly generated. Co-adapt and co-innovate in a mutually beneficial manner in domains and economies.

    How to constantly discover or combine new solutions from components and practices in existing toolboxes; another is how industries continue to combine their practices with those functions from new toolboxes (new domains).

    The second theme, similar to the first, is also about the creation of new processes and institutional arrangements, new means to achieve ends, but it is more important. This is because important new areas (eg, digital) encounter all industries in the economy.

    As this happens, domains combine the solutions they can provide with the institutional arrangements that are already in place within many industrial domains. The result is that new processes, institutional arrangements, new ways of doing things will not just be used within one region, but throughout the economy.

Evolution is a self-creating process: new elements (new technologies) are formed from those that already exist, and these new elements in turn provide building blocks for further construction. Now I want to figure out the mechanics of how this all happens. The emergence of opportunity niches calls for the birth of new technologies, and the vast majority of opportunity niches arise from technology itself, for three reasons:

• Each technology through its existence establishes an opportunity to achieve its purpose more economically or efficiently.

• Every technology always needs additional supporting technologies to make it, and these supporting technologies need their own secondary supporting technologies.

• Technology often creates indirect problems that create needs or opportunities for solutions.

The driving force gives us a big picture, where the combination of existing technologies offers the possibility of new technologies: a potential supply. And human and technological needs have created countless niches of opportunity: a need. As new technologies emerge, new opportunities continue to emerge that require further manipulation and combination. All of this is self-expanding.

So what specific steps and mechanisms are used to achieve this kind of self-expansion?

The technological body can be seen as a network that is self-constructed and organically grown outward. In this network, each technology (I'll call it an element) is represented as a point or node. Each node is connected to the parent nodes that point to it, and it is these parent nodes that make these new nodes possible. Of course, not all technologies will be actively used in the economy at a given time. It is conceivable that some nodes or elements are ready to go, and I call these elements "active technology bodies": these elements are economically viable and are used in current technology. Other elements, such as waterwheels and sailboats, are essentially dead, vanishing from the body of active technology. It is possible for them to be re-enabled in a new combination, but this rarely happens.

Statutory steps in the technical construction game. I can make this abstract, but readers may find it helpful to understand them if they have a ready-made technical case in mind at this point, say, transistors.

1. As new technology enters the active technology body as a new element, it becomes a new node in the active technology body.

2. New elements may replace existing technology or components of existing technology.

3. New elements establish further "needs" or opportunity niches for supporting technology and institutional arrangements.

4. If old, replaced technologies are gradually withdrawn from the technical body, their attachments are also discarded. The opportunity niches that come with them will disappear with them, and the elements that filled them may no longer be active.

5. New elements that are potential components of future technologies or future elements will come alive.

6. socioeconomic(Patterns of production and consumption of goods and services) are readjusted to accommodate these steps. Costs and prices (and thus incentives for new technologies) will change accordingly.

Transistors entered the active body of technology in the 1950s (step 1); replaced vacuum tubes among many applicants (step 2); established the need to manufacture semiconductor devices (step 3); led to the shrinking of the vacuum tube industry (step 3) 4);

Become a major component of many electronic devices (step 5); force changes in the price and incentives of electronic devices (step 6).

Using the transistor as an example, a new technology becomes a potential module (step 5), and is formed as soon as it appears (step 1). And the emergence of new opportunities (step 3) goes hand in hand with the emergence of new technologies (step 1). Of course, any of these steps will take time to complete. It takes time for technology to spread through the economy, and the economy in turn takes a long time to adapt to the new technology.

The construction process of the body has its own method. Each new possibility will add an element, and then the other 5 steps will follow in time. But something more interesting happened. Each step may trigger a chain of other steps. A new technology may lead to a series of further additions to the technical body (through steps 3 and 5). A price adjustment (step 6) may cause an alternative technology to suddenly become viable and enter the active process (step 1). Therefore, these steps themselves may lead to a new round of additions to technical bodies. Every new technology may start a new event, never ending.

In technology, combination is the norm. Every new technology and new solution is a combination, and a combination is applied to the capture of each phenomenon. In technology, combinatorial evolution comes first and is the norm. Variation and selection in Darwinian evolution also exist, but they are later and act upon structures that have already been formed.

Living technology: On the one hand, technology is self-organizing, it can gather itself by some simple rules; on the other hand, technology is self-generating. By these measures technology, technology is indeed living, but they are only organisms in the sense of coral reefs.

An economy is defined as a set of arrangements and activities through which a society will meet needs. (This became a staple of economic research.) The point is, what are these arrangements? Well, we'll start with the "means of production" (the industrial production process at the heart of the economy) of Victorian economists. Indeed, my definition would not surprise Karl Marx. Marx looked at the economy in terms of "instruments of production", his theory involving the large factories and textile machinery of his day.

The steps include steps 1, 2, 4 and 6, but also go through steps 5 and 3:

● New technologies provide potential new elements that can be used interactively in other technologies. It thus takes on the role of guiding the technologies that use it and adapt it. In particular, it may lead to the emergence of new organizational systems that include it.

● New technologies may create opportunity niches for further technologies. Such opportunities are created in different ways, but they arise from new technical, economic or social problems arising from new technologies. Therefore, new technology brings the need to further solve these problems with technology.

Three principles: all technologies are combinations of elements; these elements are technologies themselves; all technologies use phenomena to achieve a certain purpose. The third principle in particular reminds us that the essence of technology is the programming of nature, a capture of phenomena and harnessing them to serve human purposes. An individual technology "programs" many phenomena and orchestrates them so that they work together to accomplish a specific purpose.

Mind is composition, that is, combining the right components and functions together to form a solution. This process is both material and spiritual, but it is not the only driving force behind technological evolution. Another driver is demand, a need for a new way of doing things. And the demand that arises from the technology itself is more than the demand from humans. The driving force of demand mainly comes from the limitations and problems encountered by the technology itself, and the solutions to these problems must be obtained through further technology in turn. Therefore, requirements follow solutions, and solutions in turn follow requirements. The needs created by combinatorial evolution are equally as numerous and important as the solutions created.

The process by which all of this happens is neither uniform nor smooth. Technology collections evolve by adopting or discarding certain technologies, creating certain niches of opportunity, and uncovering new phenomena.

  Economics directs and reconciles it all. It signals demand, tests the viability of business ideas, and calls for new versions of technology. But the economy is not only the receiver of the technology, nor the receiver of the upgraded technology, but more importantly, the economy is the expression of its technology. In its structure contains a series of mutually supporting arrangements - commerce, means of production, institutions, organizations, and these are in fact technology itself in a broad sense. Business activities and conduct revolve around these arrangements. These "arrangements" create opportunities for "further arrangements," and the result is one economic restructuring after another. The economy, as a result of this process, inherits all the qualities of technology. If viewed from a large time span, the economy is also uninhibited. Like technology, the economy is open, historically dependent, hierarchical, indeterminate, and constantly changing.

The economy is becoming productive. Its focus has shifted from optimizing fixed operations to creating new combinations and new configurable products. In a reproductive economy, competitive advantage comes not only from the reserves of resources and the ability to turn these into final products, but also from the ability to transform deep knowledge reserves into new strategic combinations.
